# Jupyter_Research_Paper_Math
A research paper on using the Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi using Python and Jupyter notebook. 
LaTeX used for equations and formulas.
Project used to strengthen statistical knowledge and understand simulations.

## Method Overview
Using the monte carlo method, we find Pi by placing a circle with a diameter equal to the side of the outer square of the circle.
We then proceed to simulate placing dots in random locations within the square.
We base Pi on the dots that make it in the circle against the ones that are kept outside of it.
The more dots we place, the better our approximation will be.
